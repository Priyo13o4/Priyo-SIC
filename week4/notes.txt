-> Pandas is an extension of numpy (Used more for numerical analysis) , used more on tabular data(organised data) operations.
-> Some FILE HANDLING FILE
    os.open - > Open/load the file from disc to main memory
    os.read,write - > Read or write to the file
    os.close -> Closing / saving the file from main memory(example when closing a word file without saving it prompts for saving , where the file is stored in cache) to disc.

    this usually happens in C/C++ or java , in python pandas (pd.read) usually both opening and reading happens simultaneuosly

Evaluation scheme : 
Adequetness : 
From POV of user , what are the features,analysis and how well they are defined 
Coding practices : 
    -multiple file project ( create folder hackathon in repo)

what we can add more  : File handling , data handling , small GUI part(pyQT, tkinter , html) - These are very very optional 

importance : 
1. Code 
2. OPPS
3. Database / data /file in/op
4. Menu (GUI)
