Linked List Problems:(Create using OOP/Class)
1. Implement Queue using SLL and DLL, insert at rear delete from front
2. Implement Stack using SLL, insert and delete from front
3. Implement Stack using DLL, insert and delete from rear
4. Reverse a SLL
5. Merge 2 sorted SLLs into one sorted SLL
6. Check if 2 SLL converges at some point or not
7.make 8 fucntions for insert and delete at front , rear , postion , display f-r and r-f 
    they made need checking if queue is empty (set that new node as head),if queue not empty 
    for given postion we may need to check if that position exceeds the list or not 
8.Implement circular queue using a list 
9.Create a Matrix of (M, N) coordinates and print the Matrix in Spiral format
