-> First rule of coding is simplicity even if its not efficient.


-> Accumulator : Special Purpose register 
-> Buffer : Primary purpose to move data from one place to another 
	> Un-buffer (No delimiter): Data is sent immediately 
	> Line buffer
	> User customised Delimiters : The character that separates two values
	
	-> Recap about writing octal and hexadecimal numbers like 
	0b10010 , 0xff, 0o78
	
-> *args means the function is capable of taking variable number of arguments 
	it is a unmodifiable list , ie a tuple

ARRAYS/LIST

-> Wrapper , wrapes a primitive data type into an object ; in python wrapping is done default as python is completely OOP


Accept A number from the user(4-digit number , where the digit can repeat atmost two times) and print the count of recursions required to arrive at Karpekar's constant.
-> What is Karpekar's Constant 
steps :
1. take a 4 digit number : 6931
2. Decreasing order : 9631
3. Increasing Order : 1369 
4. difference : 8262 
	-> keep repeating : 8622 , 2268 : 6354
						6543 , 3456 : 3087
						8730 , 0378 : 8352
						8532 , 2358 : 6174 
						7641 , 1467 : 6174 ---- > Karpekar's Constant

LIST METHODS 

***FOCUS ALSO on the RETURN TYPE regardless the fucntion or language ***
class list stores a set of fucntions utilized on lists, we call them as methods by an object

	-sorted (function): 
		Og list is not mutated , but created as a copy 
	-sort (method): 
		Og list will be mutated
	-list.append(20)
	-pop()
	-list.insert(0,30)
	-del list_name[0] #can be used to delete the whole list without the parameter
	-list.empty()
	-len(list)
	-sum(list) # check the behaviour if theres a intermediate list
	-min(list) #perform the above
	-max(list)
	-list.remove(element) , check if we can remove an element

	EXECPTION : 

->An exception is a runtime error which occurs when we are asking the code to do something not possible.
		ex : opening a file which doesnt exist or is already open.
	-we put the normal flow of execution inside a try block where we suspect an exception can occur
	-Every exception has a class , an object of the exception is created , we reference it to the class, we catch that object in a except block.
	-If a specific reference class is given , it will only catch that specific exception class in that except block.
	-A generic exception block cant be before a specialized except block as the error will be unreachable as a named except clause cannot appear after catch-all except clause.

->Inheritance is extending on a class which is a tested , proven solution to a problem to add on the desired features , which the existing soltuion lacks .
	-We are either adding new features or creating a new soltuion to an existing problem, basically an increment without distrubing the existing solution.
	-Reference of a child type cannot point to the object of the parent type ,The parent type can access all the properties of the child type,
	But only those which were inhertited ie it cannot access the newly added properties of the child type.
		ex : All SUVs are Cars but not all Cars are SUVs . (More on oops on week 3 notes)
